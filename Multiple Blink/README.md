From this lab part I noticed that you can actually change the rate in which the LED blinks by writing a while loop with an if statement in it. Since I was using to two LEDs I unsigned two int variables and incremented them. Then in the if statment I assigned the variables to go with its own LED by doing this I could control the rate at which they blink(the lower the number the faster the blink and vice verse). For the G2 board I selected P1.0 and P1.6 to be the GPIO. Then set their direction be an output. Finally, I gave both of them an output of 0 to start in the off stage.

For the 5299 board I selected P1.0 and P4.7 to be the GPIO. Then set their direction be an output. Finally, I gave both of them an output of 0 to start in the off stage as well.
