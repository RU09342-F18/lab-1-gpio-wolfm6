# Off Board Blink
After programming the processor with the multiple-blink, I took it off and put it on the bread board. Then using the data sheet I wired the processor properly in order to make the LEDs blink at different rates. Pin 1 was wired to a 3.3V source to give it power for the LEDs. Pin 20 was then ran to ground. Pin 16 was set to high so the processor would not reset. Pin 2 which matched up to P1.0 and pin 6 which matched up to P1.6 had LEDs connected to them because it corresponded to the board where the LEDs were set to blink. Lastly two resistors were used to protect the processor from drawling too much current.
