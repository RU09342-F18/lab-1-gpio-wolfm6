With the G2 board in order to get the LED to blink, I first selected P1.0 to be GPIO. Then set P1.0 to be an output. Then wrote a simple while loop with an XOR statement to toggle the LED.

Now with the 5529 board, I did not have to make any changes to the code, because both boards had LEDs at P1.0.
