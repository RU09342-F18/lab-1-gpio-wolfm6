For the G2 board I set the P1.0 as an output. Then set P1.3 as resistor enable as a pull-up. Finally I set P1.3's output to be 1. After came the while loop which consisted of a delay cycle and if statement. The if statement is in order for when you push the button that LED will turn off or on. Lastly I made an XOR statement for P1.0 which was the LED port so it would toggle states when pressed by the switch.

For the 2311 the code was set up the same way except different ports were used. I set the P1.0 as an output. Then set P1.1 as resistor enable as a pull-up. Finally I set P1.1's output to be 1. After came the while loop which consisted of a delay cycle and if statement. The if statement is in order for when you push the button that LED will turn off or on. Lastly I made an XOR statement for P1.0 which was the LED port so it would toggle states when pressed by the switch.
